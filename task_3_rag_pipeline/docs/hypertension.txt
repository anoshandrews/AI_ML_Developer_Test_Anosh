Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is a long-term medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.[11] High blood pressure usually does not cause symptoms itself.[1] It is, however, a major risk factor for stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, peripheral arterial disease, vision loss, chronic kidney disease, and dementia.[2][3][4][12] Hypertension is a major cause of premature death worldwide.[13]

High blood pressure is classified as primary (essential) hypertension or secondary hypertension.[5] About 90–95% of cases are primary, defined as high blood pressure due to non-specific lifestyle and genetic factors.[5] Lifestyle factors that increase the risk include excess salt in the diet, excess body weight, smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol use.[1][5] The remaining 5–10% of cases are categorized as secondary hypertension, defined as high blood pressure due to a clearly identifiable cause, such as chronic kidney disease, narrowing of the kidney arteries, an endocrine disorder, or the use of birth control pills.[5]

Blood pressure is classified by two measurements, the systolic (first number) and diastolic (second number) pressures.[1] For most adults, normal blood pressure at rest is within the range of 100–140 millimeters mercury (mmHg) systolic and 60–90 mmHg diastolic.[6][7] For most adults, high blood pressure is present if the resting blood pressure is persistently at or above 130/80 or 140/90 mmHg.[5][6][7] Different numbers apply to children.[14] Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over a 24-hour period appears more accurate than office-based blood pressure measurement.[5][11]

Lifestyle changes and medications can lower blood pressure and decrease the risk of health complications.[8] Lifestyle changes include weight loss, physical exercise, decreased salt intake, reducing alcohol intake, and a healthy diet.[5] If lifestyle changes are not sufficient, blood pressure medications are used.[8] Up to three medications taken concurrently can control blood pressure in 90% of people.[5] The treatment of moderately high arterial blood pressure (defined as >160/100 mmHg) with medications is associated with an improved life expectancy.[15] The effect of treatment of blood pressure between 130/80 mmHg and 160/100 mmHg is less clear, with some reviews finding benefit[6][16][17][18]and others finding unclear benefit.[19][20] High blood pressure affects 33% of the population globally.[9] About half of all people with high blood pressure do not know that they have it.[9] In 2019, high blood pressure was believed to have been a factor in 19% of all deaths (10.4 million globally).[9]

Signs and symptoms
Hypertension is rarely accompanied by symptoms.[1] Half of all people with hypertension are unaware that they have it.[9] Hypertension is usually identified as part of health screening or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem.

Some people with high blood pressure report headaches, as well as lightheadedness, vertigo, tinnitus (buzzing or hissing in the ears), altered vision or fainting episodes.[21] These symptoms, however, might be related to associated anxiety rather than the high blood pressure itself.[22]

Long-standing untreated hypertension can cause organ damage with signs such as changes in the optic fundus seen by ophthalmoscopy.[23] The severity of hypertensive retinopathy correlates roughly with the duration or the severity of the hypertension.[21] Other hypertension-caused organ damage include chronic kidney disease and thickening of the heart muscle.[9]

Secondary hypertension
Main article: Secondary hypertension
Secondary hypertension is hypertension due to an identifiable cause and may result in certain specific additional signs and symptoms. For example, as well as causing high blood pressure, Cushing's syndrome frequently causes truncal obesity,[24] glucose intolerance, moon face, a hump of fat behind the neck and shoulders (referred to as a buffalo hump), and purple abdominal stretch marks.[25] Hyperthyroidism frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite, fast heart rate, bulging eyes, and tremor. Renal artery stenosis may be associated with a localized abdominal bruit to the left or right of the midline, or in both locations. Coarctation of the aorta frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms, or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses. Pheochromocytoma may cause abrupt episodes of hypertension accompanied by headache, palpitations, pale appearance, and excessive sweating.[25]

Hypertensive crisis
Main article: Hypertensive crisis
Severely elevated blood pressure (equal to or greater than a systolic pressure of 180 mmHg or a diastolic pressure of 120 mmHg) is referred to as a hypertensive crisis.[26] Hypertensive crisis is categorized as either hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency, according to the absence or presence of end-organ damage, respectively.[27][28]

In hypertensive urgency, there is no evidence of end-organ damage resulting from the elevated blood pressure. In these cases, oral medications are used to lower blood pressure over 24 to 48 hours gradually.[29]

In a hypertensive emergency, there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs.[30][31] The most affected organs include the brain, kidney, heart, and lungs, producing symptoms that may include confusion, drowsiness, chest pain, and breathlessness.[29] In a hypertensive emergency, the blood pressure must be reduced more rapidly to stop ongoing organ damage;[29] however, there is a lack of randomized controlled trial evidence for this approach.[31]

Pregnancy
Main articles: Gestational hypertension and Pre-eclampsia
Hypertension occurs in approximately 8–10% of pregnancies.[25] Two blood pressure measurements six hours apart of greater than 140/90 mmHg are diagnostic of hypertension in pregnancy.[32] High blood pressure in pregnancy can be classified as pre-existing hypertension, gestational hypertension, or pre-eclampsia.[33] Women who have chronic hypertension before their pregnancy are at increased risk of complications such as premature birth, low birthweight or stillbirth.[34] Women who have high blood pressure and had complications in their pregnancy have three times the risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to women with normal blood pressure who had no complications in pregnancy.[35][36]

Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition in the second half of pregnancy and following delivery characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine.[25] It occurs in about 5% of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16% of all maternal deaths globally.[25] Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of death of the baby around the time of birth.[25] Usually, there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia, and it is detected by routine screening. When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur, the most common are headache, visual disturbance (often "flashing lights"), vomiting, pain over the stomach, and swelling. Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called eclampsia, which is a hypertensive emergency and has several serious complications including vision loss, brain swelling, seizures, kidney failure, pulmonary edema, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a blood clotting disorder).[25][37]

In contrast, gestational hypertension is defined as new-onset hypertension during pregnancy without protein in the urine.[33]

There have been significant findings on how exercising can help reduce the effects of hypertension just after one bout of exercise. Exercising can help reduce hypertension as well as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.

The acute physiological responses include an increase in cardiac output (CO) of the individual (increased heart rate and stroke volume). This increase in CO can inadvertently maintain the amount of blood going into the muscles, improving the functionality of the muscle later. Exercising can also improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, making it easier for blood to pump to the body. Through regular bouts of physical activity, blood pressure can be reduced and lower the incidence of hypertension.[38]

Aerobic exercise has been shown to regulate blood pressure more effectively than resistance training. It is recommended to see the effects of exercising, that a person should aim for 5-7 days/ week of aerobic exercise. This type of exercise should have an intensity of light to moderate, utilizing ~85% of max heart rate (220-age). Aerobic has shown a decrease in SBP by 5-15 mmHg, versus resistance training, showing a decrease of only 3-5 mmHg. Aerobic exercises such as jogging, rowing, dancing, or hiking can decrease SBP the most. The decrease in SBP can regulate the effect of hypertension, ensuring the baby will not be harmed. Resistance training takes a toll on the cardiovascular system in untrained individuals, leading to a reluctance in the prescription of resistance training for hypertensive reduction purposes.[39][40]

Children
Failure to thrive, seizures, irritability, lack of energy, and difficulty in breathing[41] can be associated with hypertension in newborns and young infants. In older infants and children, hypertension can cause headache, unexplained irritability, fatigue, failure to thrive, blurred vision, nosebleeds, and facial paralysis.[41][42]

Causes
Primary hypertension
Main article: Essential hypertension
Primary (also termed essential) hypertension results from a complex interaction of genes and environmental factors. More than 2000 common genetic variants with small effects on blood pressure have been identified in association with high blood pressure,[43] as well as some rare genetic variants with large effects on blood pressure.[44] There is also evidence that DNA methylation at multiple nearby CpG sites may link some sequence variation to blood pressure, possibly via effects on vascular or renal function.[45]

Blood pressure rises with aging in societies with a western diet and lifestyle,[46] and the risk of becoming hypertensive in later life is substantial in most such societies.[47] Several environmental or lifestyle factors influence blood pressure. Reducing dietary salt intake lowers blood pressure;[48] as does weight loss,[49] exercise training,[50] vegetarian diets,[51] increased dietary potassium intake[52] and high dietary calcium supplementation.[53] Increasing alcohol intake is associated with higher blood pressure,[54] but the possible roles of other factors such as caffeine consumption,[55] and vitamin D deficiency[56] are less clear. Average blood pressure is higher in the winter than in the summer.[57]

Depression is associated with hypertension[58] and loneliness is also a risk factor.[59] Periodontal disease is also associated with high blood pressure.[60] Arsenic exposure through drinking water is associated with elevated blood pressure.[61] Air pollution is associated with hypertension.[62] Whether these associations are causal is unknown. Gout and elevated blood uric acid are associated with hypertension[63] and evidence from genetic (Mendelian Randomization) studies and clinical trials indicate this relationship is likely to be causal.[64] Insulin resistance, which is common in obesity and is a component of syndrome X (or metabolic syndrome), can cause hyperuricemia and gout[65] and is also associated with elevated blood pressure.[66]

Events in early life, such as low birth weight, maternal smoking, and lack of breastfeeding may be risk factors for adult essential hypertension, although the strength of the relationships is weak and the mechanisms linking these exposures to adult hypertension remain unclear.[67]

Secondary hypertension
Main article: Secondary hypertension
Secondary hypertension results from an identifiable cause. Kidney disease is the most common secondary cause of hypertension.[25] Hypertension can also be caused by endocrine conditions, such as Cushing's syndrome, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, acromegaly, Conn's syndrome or hyperaldosteronism, renal artery stenosis (from atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia), hyperparathyroidism, and pheochromocytoma.[25][68] Other causes of secondary hypertension include obesity, sleep apnea, pregnancy, coarctation of the aorta, excessive eating of liquorice, excessive drinking of alcohol, certain prescription medicines, herbal remedies, and stimulants such as cocaine and methamphetamine.[25][69]

A 2018 review found that any alcohol increased blood pressure in males, while over one or two drinks increased the risk in females.[70]

Determinants of mean arterial pressure

Illustration depicting the effects of high blood pressure
In most people with established essential hypertension, increased resistance to blood flow (total peripheral resistance) accounts for the high pressure while cardiac output remains normal.[71] There is evidence that some younger people with prehypertension or 'borderline hypertension' have high cardiac output, an elevated heart rate and normal peripheral resistance, termed hyperkinetic borderline hypertension.[72] These individuals may develop the typical features of established essential hypertension in later life as their cardiac output falls and peripheral resistance rises with age.[72] Whether this pattern is typical of all people who ultimately develop hypertension is disputed.[73] The increased peripheral resistance in established hypertension is mainly attributable to structural narrowing of small arteries and arterioles,[74] although a reduction in the number or density of capillaries may also contribute.[75]

It is unclear whether or not vasoconstriction of arteriolar blood vessels plays a role in hypertension.[76] Hypertension is also associated with decreased peripheral venous compliance,[77] which may increase venous return, increase cardiac preload and, ultimately, cause diastolic dysfunction. For patients having hypertension, higher heart rate variability (HRV) is a risk factor for atrial fibrillation.[78]

Pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure) is frequently increased in older people with hypertension.[79] This can mean that systolic pressure is abnormally high, but diastolic pressure may be normal or low, a condition termed isolated systolic hypertension.[80] The high pulse pressure in elderly people with hypertension or isolated systolic hypertension is explained by increased arterial stiffness, which typically accompanies aging and may be exacerbated by high blood pressure.[81]

Many mechanisms have been proposed to account for the rise in peripheral resistance in hypertension. Most evidence implicates either disturbances in the kidneys' salt and water handling (particularly abnormalities in the intrarenal renin–angiotensin system)[82] or abnormalities of the sympathetic nervous system.[83] These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and both likely contribute to some extent in most cases of essential hypertension. It has also been suggested that endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation may also contribute to increased peripheral resistance and vascular damage in hypertension.[84][85] Interleukin 17 has garnered interest for its role in increasing the production of several other immune system chemical signals thought to be involved in hypertension such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1, interleukin 6, and interleukin 8.[86]

Excessive sodium or insufficient potassium in the diet leads to excessive intracellular sodium, which contracts vascular smooth muscle, restricting blood flow and so increases blood pressure.[87][88] Non-modulating essential hypertension is a form of salt-sensitive hypertension, where sodium intake does not modulate either adrenal or renal vascular responses to angiotensin II.[89] They make up 25% of the hypertensive population.[90]

Diagnosis
Hypertension is diagnosed based on persistently high resting blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure measurements on at least two separate occasions are required for a diagnosis of hypertension.[6][7][13]

Measurement technique
For an accurate diagnosis of hypertension to be made, proper blood pressure measurement technique must be used.[91] Improper measurement of blood pressure is common and can change the blood pressure reading by up to 10 mmHg, which can lead to misdiagnosis and misclassification of hypertension.[91] The correct blood pressure measurement technique involves several steps. Proper blood pressure measurement requires the person whose blood pressure is being measured to sit quietly for at least five minutes, which is then followed by the application of a properly fitted blood pressure cuff to a bare upper arm.[91] The person should be seated with their back supported, feet flat on the floor, and with their legs uncrossed.[91] The person whose blood pressure is being measured should avoid talking or moving during this process.[91] The arm being measured should be supported on a flat surface at the level of the heart.[91] Blood pressure measurement should be done in a quiet room so the medical professional checking the blood pressure can hear the Korotkoff sounds while listening to the brachial artery with a stethoscope for accurate blood pressure measurements.[91][92] The blood pressure cuff should be deflated slowly (2–3 mmHg per second) while listening for the Korotkoff sounds.[92] The bladder should be emptied before a person's blood pressure is measured since this can increase blood pressure by up to 15/10 mmHg.[91] Multiple blood pressure readings (at least two) spaced 1–2 minutes apart should be obtained to ensure accuracy.[92] Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring over 12 to 24 hours is the most accurate method to confirm the diagnosis.[93] An exception to this is those with very high blood pressure readings, especially when there is poor organ function.[94]

With the availability of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitors and home blood pressure machines, the importance of not wrongly diagnosing those who have white coat hypertension has led to a change in protocols. In the United Kingdom, the current best practice is to follow up a single raised clinic reading with ambulatory measurement, or, less ideally, with home blood pressure monitoring over 7 days.[94] The United States Preventive Services Task Force also recommends getting measurements outside of the healthcare environment.[93] Pseudohypertension in the elderly or noncompressibility artery syndrome may also require consideration. This condition is believed to be due to calcification of the arteries, resulting in abnormally high blood pressure readings with a blood pressure cuff, while intra-arterial measurements of blood pressure are normal.[95] Orthostatic hypertension is when blood pressure increases upon standing.[96]

Other investigations
Once the diagnosis of hypertension has been made, further testing may be performed to find secondary hypertension, identify comorbidities such as diabetes, identify hypertension-caused organ damage such as chronic kidney disease or thickening of the heart muscle, and for cardiovascular disease risk stratification.[9]

Secondary hypertension is more common in preadolescent children, with most cases caused by kidney disease. Primary or essential hypertension is more common in adolescents and adults and has multiple risk factors, including obesity and a family history of hypertension.[97]

Initial assessment upon diagnosis of hypertension should include a complete history and physical examination. The World Health Organization suggests the following initial tests: serum electrolytes, serum creatinine, lipid panel, HbA1c or fasting glucose, urine dipstick and electrocardiogram (ECG/EKG).[9] Serum creatinine is measured to assess for the presence of kidney disease, which can be either the cause or the result of hypertension.[30] eGFR can also provide a baseline measurement of kidney function that can be used to monitor for side effects of certain anti-hypertensive drugs on kidney function. Testing of urine samples for protein is used as a secondary indicator of kidney disease. Lipid panel and glucose tests are done to identify comorbidities such as diabetes and hyperlipidemia and for cardiovascular risk stratification. Electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG) testing is done to check for evidence that the heart is under strain from high blood pressure, such as thickening of the heart muscle or whether the heart has experienced a prior minor disturbance, such as a silent heart attack.
